              </span>Union government has allowed commercial export of Covishield and Covaxin considering the sufficient stock of the COVID-19 vaccines available with states and Union Territories as well as with manufacturers, official sources said on Thursday. However, the quantity of Covid vaccines to be exported will be decided by the government every month to ensure there is no dearth of domestic availability. Bharat Biotech has said in a statement that its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin meets WHO efficacy criteria for COVID-19 vaccines for the dreaded Delta variant. This comes after Lancet published the results of an interim study showing that two doses of Covaxin had 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic disease and presented no serious safety concerns. Fifty-four students are now positive for coronavirus at Vimsar, a medical college and hospital in Odisha's Sambalpur - up from 34 on Wednesday, an official said, reported news agency PTI. The Asian Development Bank has approved a USD 1.5 billion (around Rs 11,185 crore) loan to India for COVID-19. India reported 9,119 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, pushing the cumulative national tally to 3,45,35,763, while the death count increased to 4,66,584 with 396 related fatalities. The active coronavirus cases in India now stand at 1,11,481, the lowest in 538 days, according to the health ministry. For 47 straight days the country has been reporting below 20,000 new infections daily. With 10,264 fresh recoveries, the active caseload dropped to 1,09,940 which is the lowest in the 539 days.  The recovery tally has now gone up to 3,39,67,962.  More than 119 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered so far under the Nationwide Vaccination Drive.

Germany's death toll on Thursday passed 100,000 as the European country continues to battle with the fourth wave of deadly coronavirus. It recorded 351 fatalities in the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 100,119, reports the Robert Koch Institute.  Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday renewed her call for tougher curbs to halt record coronavirus infections in Germany, stressing that "every day counts" as the country's Covid-19 death count passed the 100,000 mark.  French Health Minister Olivier Veran said Thursday that Covid-19 booster shots would be made available to all adults from this weekend to counter a new wave of infections.  World Health Organization officials met on Thursday to discuss a new coronavirus variant circulating in South Africa and Botswana.  The new variant, called B.1.1529, carries an unusually large number of mutations, Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute, said in a statement published by the Science Media Centre. It's likely to have evolved during chronic infection of an immuno-compromised person, possibly in an untreated HIV/AIDS patient, he said.  New cases have jumped 23% in the Americas in the last week, mostly in North America, in a sign that the region might also face a resurgence of infections.  COVID-19 vaccination is safe for pregnant women and not associated with higher rates of complications, data released by the UK Health Security Agency showed on Thursday, as officials urged pregnant women to take up the offer of shots. European Union residents will need to have COVID-19 vaccine booster jabs if they want to travel to another country in the bloc next summer free of tests or quarantines, the European Commission proposed on Thursday. Slovakia went into a two-week lockdown on Thursday, as the country with one of the EU's lowest vaccination rates reported a critical situation in hospitals and new infections that topped global tables.

Designing, realising, and testing cryogenic rocket engines fully in the private sector is a great milestone for the country. Reiterating that cryogenic engines are highly efficient rocket propulsion systems that use propellants at cryogenic temperatures (less than -150° Celsius). Cryogenic engines are highly suitable for the upper stages of a rocket as they have a higher specific impulse that enhances payload carrying capability. Skyroot kicked off India’s first private project to develop a small fully cryogenic engine with fabrication of a prototype engine to be used as a technology demonstrator in September 2020.

The matter came to light after a complaint was filed with the Delhi Police in July this year. The complainant said he was cheated after he rang a phone number to make a cheque-related query. The number was listed on Google as a customer service number for Canara Bank. Following this, he found that Rs 27.10 lakh had been transferred from his bank account to eight other accounts.

Thereafter, from Saturday to Monday, November 27-29, isolated heavy to very heavy rains have been forecast across south-coastal Andhra Pradesh, Yanam and Rayalaseema.  In view of these predictions, the IMD has issued a yellow watch (‘be aware’ of local weather situation) over Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema on Friday and Saturday.

              </span> The report prepared by CPCB regarding Mumbai’s sewage treatment found a gap of 31 per cent between sewage generation and collection by networks laid by the civic body.  Earlier, in the same case, NGT had ordered the municipal commissioner to remain present before it. However, the BMC had approached the Supreme Court and got relief against the order, but the apex court had allowed NGT’s proceeding against the BMC on sea pollution.

              </span> In March 2014, the trial court had convicted four persons for gangraping a 22-year-old photojournalist inside the abandoned Shakti Mills compound in central Mumbai on August 22, 2013. The court had then imposed the death penalty on three of the convicts as they were also convicted for gang-raping a 19-year-old telephone operator at the same place months before raping the photojournalist. A division bench of Justices commuted the sentences of Vijay Jadhav, Mohammad Qasim Shaikh, and Mohammad Ansar from the death penalty to life imprisonment for the remainder of their lives stating that they "deserve imprisonment for life to repent the offence committed by them".

              </span>  According to the report, the accounts claimed to be ‘real Sikhs’ and ‘proud Indians’ and used profile pictures stolen from celebrities’ social media accounts. The accounts were posting the same content on multiple social media platforms. All these accounts used repetitive hashtags such as #RealSikhAgainstKhalistanis #Khalistanis #SikhRejectKhalistan. According to a BBC report released, the research by the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR)  titled Analysis of the #RealSikh Influence Operation identified a core network of fake accounts that targeted “other accounts supportive of Indian nationalism in order to spread and amplify the content and narratives generated by the core network”. The network increased its activity since the commencement of the farmers’ protests in India. Both the farmers’ protests and the Khalistan independence movement have been the two most frequently targeted subjects of the core network of fake accounts
